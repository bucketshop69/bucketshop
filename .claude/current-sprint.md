# Current Sprint: Position Creation Flow

**Status**: ✅ SPRINT COMPLETE - Position Creation UX Implementation
**Current Story**: Transform position creation from complex dual-token inputs to intuitive SOL allocation-based flow with smart calculations and context-aware recommendations
**Active Branch**: `feature/position-creation`

## Sprint Objectives
Replace token-centric position creation with user-friendly SOL allocation flow. Users think in capital allocation terms while system handles all token mathematics and optimization.

## Business Requirements Reference
See `.claude/business-requirements.md` for complete business logic and requirements.

  - ✅ Add button toggles: "Single token position" vs "Both tokens position"
  - ✅ Conditional token selection (TokenX/TokenY) for single positions
  - ✅ State management: `positionType`, `selectedToken`
  - ✅ Progressive disclosure based on position type selection
  - **Learning Goal**: Multi-step form patterns and progressive disclosure UX

- [x] Task 2: SOL Allocation Interface (Frontend Developer) **✅ COMPLETE**

  - **Branch**: `feature/position-creation`
  - **Business Logic**: Implement Step 3 from business requirements
  - ✅ Real-time token amount calculations based on position type
  - ✅ Single TokenX: Calculate `tokenXNeeded = totalSol / currentPrice`
  - ✅ Single TokenY: Direct SOL usage, no conversion needed
  - ✅ Both tokens: Optimal ratio splitting based on strategy and range
  - ✅ Display previews: "Will buy ~X.XX TokenX" or "Will use X SOL + Y SOL"
  - ✅ State management: `calculatedTokenXAmount`, `calculatedTokenYAmount`, `requiresSwap`
  - **Learning Goal**: Financial calculations and real-time preview patterns

- [x] Task 4: Context-Aware Strategy & Range Selection (UX Specialist) **✅ COMPLETE**
  - **Branch**: `feature/position-creation`
  - **Business Logic**: Implement Steps 4-6 from business requirements
  - ✅ Enhanced strategy selection with recommendations and visual indicators
  - ✅ BrushBarChart visual bin representation for range selection
  - ✅ Asymmetric range defaults for single token positions
  - ✅ Final transaction preview with edit/confirm functionality
  - ✅ Complete state management integration
  - **Learning Goal**: Context-aware UI and complex form state orchestration

## Position Creation Flow Architecture

### User Journey
1. **Select Position Type** → Single token (directional) or Both tokens (traditional LP)
2. **Choose SOL Amount** → Capital allocation with balance validation
3. **Preview Calculations** → See token amounts and swap requirements
4. **Configure Strategy/Range** → Context-aware recommendations
5. **Confirm Preview** → Final transaction summary and execution

### Technical Flow
```
Position Type Selection → SOL Allocation → Token Calculations → 
Strategy/Range Configuration → Transaction Preview → Ready for Execution
```

## State Management Architecture

### Core State Structure
```typescript
interface PositionCreationState {
  // Step 1: Position Type
  positionType: 'single' | 'both'
  selectedToken: 'tokenX' | 'tokenY' | null
  
  // Step 2: SOL Allocation
  totalSolAllocation: number
  availableSolBalance: number
  
  // Step 3: Calculated Amounts
  calculatedTokenXAmount: number
  calculatedTokenYAmount: number
  requiresSwap: boolean
  swapAmount: number
  
  // Step 4: Strategy & Range
  strategy: 'spot' | 'curve' | 'bidask'
  recommendedStrategy: string
  rangeMin: number
  rangeMax: number
  rangeType: 'symmetric' | 'asymmetric-above' | 'asymmetric-below'
  
  // Final Preview
  transactionPreview: {
    solAllocated: number
    tokensToAcquire: { tokenX: number, tokenY: number }
    positionRange: { min: number, max: number }
    transactionCount: number
    estimatedGasFees: number
  }
}
```

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. Real-Time Calculations
- Immediate updates as user adjusts SOL allocation
- Complex ratio splitting for "both tokens" positions
- Price impact calculations for large allocations

### 2. Context-Aware UI
- Dynamic strategy recommendations based on position type
- Asymmetric range configuration for single token positions
- Progressive form validation and error states

### 3. State Orchestration
- Multiple interdependent form steps
- Bidirectional editing capabilities (user can go back and modify)
- Consistent state management across complex calculations

## Success Criteria

## Integration Strategy

### Current Sprint Scope (Form Flow Only)
- ✅ **Position type selection and token choice**
- ✅ **SOL allocation with balance integration**
- ✅ **Smart token amount calculations and previews**
- ✅ **Enhanced strategy selection with recommendations**
- ✅ **Asymmetric range configuration for single positions**

- ❌ **Position creation via Meteora SDK**
- ❌ **Error handling for failed transactions**

## Component Architecture

### New Components to Build

- **TokenPreviewCard**: Display calculated token amounts and swap requirements
- **ContextAwareStrategySelector**: Enhanced strategy selection with recommendations
- **AsymmetricRangeSelector**: Range configuration for single token positions
- **TransactionPreviewCard**: Final confirmation summary

### Integration Points
- **PoolDetailView**: Replace current PositionConfigForm placeholder
- **Meteora Service**: Use existing pool data for price calculations
- **State Management**: New Redux slice for position creation state

## Development Approach

### Task 1 Focus: Position Type Foundation
