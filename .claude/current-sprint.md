- [ ] Task 5: Order Execution System (Trading Backend Developer) **‚Üê CURRENT**
  - **Branch**: `feature/order-execution`
  - Connect trading buttons to actual order placement
  - Market order execution with size validation
  - Transaction confirmation and error handling
  - User feedback for successful/failed trades

## Trading System Priorities (High to Low):
1. **Critical Account Setup** - User must have Drift account before trading
2. **Important Order Execution** - Core trading functionality with market orders
3. **Nice-to-have Error Handling** - Robust error handling and user feedback

## Drift Trading Tools & Framework:
**Primary Stack**:
- **@drift-labs/sdk**: Client-side trading operations and account management
- **@privy-io/react-auth**: Wallet connection and transaction signing
- **@solana/web3.js**: Solana blockchain interactions

**Integration Strategy**:
- **Server-side DriftService**: Static market data and configuration (existing)
- **Client-side DriftTradingService**: Wallet-connected trading operations (existing)
- **Account Management**: Check/create/initialize Drift accounts

## Success Criteria:
- [x] **Functional Trading Interface** - Users can interact with trading form ‚úÖ
- [x] **Wallet Integration Complete** - Seamless wallet connection with Privy ‚úÖ
- [x] **Account Setup Working** - Users can create and initialize Drift accounts ‚úÖ
- [x] **Deposit System Working** - Users can deposit SOL for trading collateral ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Order Execution Live** - Users can place actual market orders
- [ ] **Learning Goal Achieved** - Co-developer understands complete Drift trading flow

## Next Session Instructions:
**Role to assume**: Trading Backend Developer specializing in order execution
**Task**: Implement Task 5 - Order Execution System (LONG/SHORT button functionality)
**Learning goal**: Understand Drift market order placement and transaction handling

**Current Status**: Account creation ‚úÖ and deposit system ‚úÖ are complete. The LONG/SHORT buttons in the trading panel are connected to order execution methods but not yet functional. The `/api/drift/place-order` endpoint exists and uses the same hybrid transaction pattern as account creation and deposits. 

**Key Context**: 
- Hybrid transaction flow working: server creates unsigned tx, client signs & submits
- DriftServerService.createOrderTransaction() method exists but needs testing
- Market orders use: OrderType.MARKET, PositionDirection.LONG/SHORT, baseAssetAmount
- Users must have Drift account + SOL collateral before placing orders
