# Current Sprint: DApp-Centric Architecture Refactoring

**Status**: 🏆 REFACTOR SPRINT - Code Architecture Overhaul **85% COMPLETE**
**Current Story**: Transform scattered codebase into scalable DApp-centric architecture for multi-protocol expansion
**Active Branch**: `refactor/dapp-centric-architecture`

## Architecture & Task Breakdown:
- [x] Task 1: Foundation Setup (DevOps Specialist) **COMPLETED** ✅
  - **Branch**: `refactor/dapp-centric-architecture` 
  - ✅ Created routing structure with `app/(dapps)/` group
  - ✅ Set up 70/30 layout structure in DApp layout
  - ✅ Created landing page with DApp navigation button
  - ✅ Moved business logic to DApp layout
  - ✅ Installed and integrated Zustand for state management

- [x] Task 2: Navigation & Shared Components (Frontend Architecture Specialist) **COMPLETED** ✅
  - **Branch**: `refactor/dapp-centric-architecture`
  - ✅ Created `shared/components/navigation/` for DApp navigation
  - ✅ Built DApp navigation (Drift/Meteora/Jupiter/Kamino)
  - ✅ Built dynamic tab navigation for Drift routes
  - ✅ Integrated 3-layer navigation into 30% action panel

- [x] Task 3: Drift Markets Store Implementation (State Management Specialist) **COMPLETED** ✅
  - **Branch**: `refactor/dapp-centric-architecture`
  - ✅ Created normalized `driftMarketsStore` with efficient lookups
  - ✅ Integrated SWR data fetching with Zustand state management
  - ✅ Implemented auto-selection of default market (SOL-PERP)
  - ✅ Added proper error handling and loading states
  - ✅ Used server-side MarketData types for consistency

- [x] Task 4: URL-Driven State Implementation (State Management Specialist) **COMPLETED** ✅
  - **Branch**: `refactor/dapp-centric-architecture`
  - ✅ Implemented `/drift/markets` route for market discovery
  - ✅ Implemented `/drift/[symbol]/trade` route for trading interface
  - ✅ Connected market selection to chart data updates
  - ✅ Made navigation components respond to route changes
  - ✅ Implemented dynamic tab navigation based on selected market

- [x] Task 5: Import Path Migration (Refactoring Specialist) **COMPLETED** ✅
  - **Branch**: `refactor/dapp-centric-architecture`
  - ✅ Updated all component imports to use new driftMarketsStore
  - ✅ Migrated ChartContainer, useRealTime, and trading pages
  - ✅ Fixed all broken marketStore dependencies
  - ✅ Removed unused imports and cleaned up TypeScript errors

- [ ] Task 6: Legacy Code Cleanup (Code Quality Specialist) **REMAINING** 🔄
  - **Branch**: `refactor/dapp-centric-architecture`
  - Delete old scattered marketStore files
  - Remove unused navigation components
  - Clean up redundant route structures
  - Run linting and ensure no unused code remains

## Major Accomplishments ✅:
- **Clean URL Structure**: `/drift/markets` → `/drift/sol-perp/trade` flow working
- **Normalized State**: Efficient O(1) market lookups by marketIndex
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Tab navigation that responds to selected market
- **Zero Regressions**: All existing functionality maintained
- **Type Safety**: Server-side types reused consistently across client
- **Auto-Selection**: Default market selection ensures chart always has data

## Success Criteria Status:
- [x] **Scalable Structure** - Adding Jupiter requires only creating `features/jupiter/`
- [x] **Clean Imports** - All imports follow consistent `@/shared/store/drift/` patterns
- [x] **URL-Driven UX** - `/drift/sol-perp/trade` shows SOL chart + Drift trading panel
- [x] **State Isolation** - Drift state completely separated from future Jupiter state
- [x] **Zero Regression** - All existing functionality works exactly the same
- [x] **Team Readiness** - Clear ownership boundaries for adding new DApps
- [x] **Learning Goal** - Large-scale refactoring patterns and architectural decision-making

## Next Steps:
1. **Complete Task 6**: Clean up old files and run final linting
2. **Commit & PR**: Create pull request with comprehensive changes
3. **Future Sprints**: Ready for Jupiter/Meteora DApp additions

**Result**: Successfully transformed technical debt into scalable architecture that supports rapid DApp expansion.
